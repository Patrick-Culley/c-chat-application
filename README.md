Chat application I created to experiment with and learn socket programming. Application is based on the client-server model using IPv4.  

Learning/Learned: 
- Client-Server architecture & messaging protocols

- Message parsing and processing using string manipulation 
- Sockets and establishing connections between processes over a network 
- Threading
