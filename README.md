![test](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85924348/235343342-f7848048-6c14-4ecf-b2d6-e508375507d9.gif)

Chat application I created to experiment on in order to teach myself socket programming. Application is based on the client-server model, using multithreading to handle 
several clients within a process. Utilizes a linked list to add client connections.  

Learning/Learned: 
- Threading & Multithreading
- Message parsing 
- Client-Server architecture 
- Messaging protocols 
- IP addressing and ports  
- Processing using string manipulation 
- Establishing connections between processes over a network
